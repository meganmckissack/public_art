#PUBLIC ART IN PORTLAND OREGON
Public art maps and charts for Portland Oregon

Data are from the Portland Civic Apps [link here](http://www.civicapps.org). It is hoped this app will aid in public awreness and appreciation of the art we have in our community.  

##RAW DATA  
The raw data are downloaded from [http://www.civicapps.org/datasets/public-art](http://www.civicapps.org/datasets/public-art) as a zipped csv file. The file as downloaded proved hard to read into R so I unzipped the csv, opened it in Apple Keynote, assigned formats (either text, number, or date) to each column, and the stored it as public_art_edited.csv. Apart from that, not other changes or edits were made to the file. The edited file, along with the original zip file,  are available in the repository.
